    "In mathematics and programming, arithmetic expressions are used to perform mathematical operations on one or more operands, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n",

    "Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2 + 3`: This expression adds 2 and 3, and the result is 5.\n",

    "- `4 * 6`: This expression multiplies 4 and 6, and the result is 24.\n",
    "- `10 / 2`: This expression divides 10 by 2, and the result is 5.\n",
    "- `5 ** 2`: This expression raises 5 to the power of 2, and the result is 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use parentheses to group operations and change the order of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(2 + 3) * 4`: This expression adds 2 and 3, and then multiplies the result by 4. The result is 20.\n",
    "\n",
